# Credit Card Fraud Detection - Project Synopsis

## Project Overview
The exponential growth of e-commerce has led to an increase in credit card transactions and a corresponding rise in fraud cases. This project explores machine learning techniques to detect fraudulent transactions efficiently, aiding banks and financial institutions in mitigating fraud risks.

## Abstract and Scope
Credit card fraud detection is a crucial challenge faced by financial institutions. Traditional methods struggle to keep pace with evolving fraud techniques. Machine learning offers a promising solution by analyzing transaction patterns and predicting fraudulent activity. This project investigates the effectiveness of logistic regression, decision trees, and random forest models in detecting fraudulent transactions using a dataset from Kaggle.

### Keywords:
- Fraud Detection
- Credit Card
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest

## Feasibility Study
Credit card fraud includes unauthorized transactions made using stolen credentials, leading to identity theft and financial loss. Reports indicate that around **10 million fraudulent transactions** occur annually, amounting to significant financial damages. Fraud detection systems aim to control and prevent such incidents by analyzing transaction data and identifying anomalies.

## Methodology
This project compares multiple machine learning techniques to identify the most effective approach for fraud detection. The dataset consists of **284,808** credit card transactions from a European bank, with fraud cases labeled as the "positive class" and genuine ones as the "negative class."

The following algorithms are analyzed:
1. **Logistic Regression** - A statistical approach for binary classification.
2. **Decision Tree** - A tree-based method that segments transactions based on fraud likelihood.
3. **Random Forest** - An ensemble learning technique improving detection accuracy.

The evaluation framework includes:
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Training and testing multiple ML models
- Comparing performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score

## Results & Findings
The project evaluates different ML models and determines the most suitable algorithm for real-world credit card fraud detection. Performance metrics are compared to assess effectiveness and optimize fraud detection strategies.

## Future Enhancements
- Improving feature selection techniques to enhance model accuracy
- Exploring deep learning approaches for better fraud prediction
- Implementing real-time fraud detection using big data processing frameworks

## References
A comprehensive study of credit card fraud detection techniques has been conducted based on various research papers and datasets.

## Conclusion
This project aims to enhance fraud detection mechanisms using machine learning, ensuring a secure and efficient transaction system for banks and financial institutions. By leveraging advanced algorithms, fraudulent activities can be minimized, reducing financial losses and safeguarding user data.
